# Description
AM2R Bingo 1.0 by Electrix

This is the repository for my AM2R bingo board generator, which runs on GitHub Pages.
https://electrixcodes.github.io/AM2RBingo/board.html

## Usage
1. The website will generate a board. If you would like a different board, click "Generate New Board". If you would like to set a seed for the board, enter it in the text box and click "Load Seed".
2. Start a new file in AM2R 1.5 (preferably New Game+ or Random Game+). 
3. Try to complete all of the objectives in a line. To mark an objective as complete, click on its box.
4. The game ends when you complete a full line.

## Bugs & Suggestions
If you want to report a problem with the bingo generator, or make suggestions for a future version, please open an Issue on this GitHub repository. This repository is not open to contributions.

## Notes
This tool was released on March 16th, 2022. It was designed for AM2R 1.5.

For "Fully explore" tiles, you do NOT need to explore the area's exterior, or any transport pipes.
For "Finish in" tiles, time ends when you lose control of Samus.
For "Finish in [room]" tiles, time ends as soon as you enter the room.

Have fun!
